## What {{Engine Name}} Actually Is in MaxVideoAI

Plain-English description of how the engine is exposed in MaxVideoAI (not just theoretical specs). Cover:

- **Clip length options:** {{Durations}} (single generation)  
- **Output resolution:** {{Resolution}}  
- **Formats:** {{Aspect Ratios}} (e.g., 16:9, 9:16)  
- **Inputs:** Text → Video; Image → Video (list supported file types, size limits)  
- **Audio:** {{On/Off/Togglable}}  
- **Focus:** e.g., short, high-impact clips vs long-form

Outline the in-app flow (pick engine → choose T2V/I2V → set duration/aspect → paste structured prompt → see price → compare engines).

## Real Specs – {{Engine Name}} in MaxVideoAI

> These specs describe {{Engine Name}} exactly as you can use it today via MaxVideoAI.

### Duration & Output

- **Durations:** {{Durations}}  
- **Output resolution:** {{Resolution}} (e.g., 1280×720)

### Aspect Ratios

- {{Aspect Ratios}} (e.g., 16:9, 9:16)

### Inputs & File Types

- **Text prompts** – describe expected style (short cinematic sentences, shot-list style, etc.)  
- **Reference images** – list supported types and max size  
- Note if video input is or isn’t supported.

### Audio

- State default behavior (audio on/off/toggle) and how to mute/replace if needed.

### Pricing

- Internal config: `perSecondCents = {{Price in cents}}`  
- Example costs: show 2–3 durations with USD equivalents.  
- Reiterate pay-as-you-go wallet, no subscription.

> **Value proposition**: one-liner on why this engine is useful here (speed, predictability, style, etc.).

**Render timing (placeholder to fill):** In practice, renders take about {{Render time placeholder}} for a {{typical duration}} clip at {{typical resolution}}. Update this with real observations per engine.

## {{Engine Name}} Example Gallery

- Note that the page shows a live gallery powered by MaxVideoAI (same engine and settings users get).  
- Link to the broader Examples gallery filtered to this engine: `/examples/{{engine-slug}}`.  
- Explain what each card shows (preview, engine/duration, one-line description, CTA).

## Text-to-Video with {{Engine Name}}

Explain how to write prompts like a concise shot list (subject/action, environment, camera, movement, light/mood, format/duration). Provide a reusable skeleton:

> *Wide shot of [subject] in [environment], lit by [lighting], camera [movement], {{Duration}} seconds, {{Aspect}}, cinematic, natural colors.*

---

## Image-to-Video Flow

If supported, describe pairing with an image engine (e.g., Nano Banana) to lock style and iterate on motion:

1. Generate a reference frame.  
2. Send to {{Engine Name}} as Image → Video.  
3. Prompt for motion/timing, keeping style anchored.  
4. Regenerate focusing on movement while keeping composition consistent.

List when this is useful (product shots, brand consistency, looping scenes).

---

## Multi-Shot / Sequenced Clips (engine-specific)

If this engine supports sequenced prompts, describe the best pattern for it (e.g., 2–3 beats with one action + one camera move per beat, continuity tips). If not supported, swap this section for the engine’s standout capability instead (e.g., first/last frames, audio-guided timing, or ultra-fast iterations).

---

## Demo: One Sequenced Prompt (With a Matching Clip)

Provide a realistic, ready-to-run prompt with timings and aspect ratio. Include 2–3 shots with clear camera moves. Note that the page should show the actual video generated from this prompt beside the text.

---

## Tips & Limitations

**Play to its strengths:** subjects, environments, camera behavior, tone/styles it handles well.  
**Know its boundaries:** resolution/duration limits, input limits (no video input? no seeds?), small text issues, etc.  
Encourage iterative prompting and comparing with adjacent engines in the same UI.

### Page Hygiene Checklist (keep site-specific patterns)

- Hero + dual CTAs (primary “Start generating with {{Engine Name}}”, secondary compare link).  
- Mention availability (EU/UK/worldwide) and pay-as-you-go wallet.  
- Link to `/examples/{{engine-slug}}` for the filtered gallery.  
- Keep tone: practical, benefit-first, plain English (no hype).  
- Keep section order consistent with this template for SEO/internal links.  
- Use real, current specs from config when you fill in placeholders.  
- Ensure any demo prompt has a corresponding real clip in the gallery if shown.  
- Add translation-ready copy (short sentences, avoid idioms) to ease i18n.  
- Preserve MaxVideoAI naming (MaxVideoAI, not variations).  
- If a pro variant exists, add a compare link and note key differences (resolution, audio toggle, duration).  
- Reference other engines (Veo, Pika, Kling, Wan, MiniMax Hailuo, Sora, etc.) to reinforce multi-engine positioning.  
- Keep the “Example Gallery” copy aligned with existing pages (live outputs, same engine as users get).

### Implementation guide (EN base → ES Latam, FR, JSON, wiring)

- **Use the onboarding flow first**: run `npm run model:setup -- --from <existing-model-slug> --slug {{engine}} --name "{{Engine Name}}" --family <family-id>` from the repo root. This clones the live marketing JSON shape into `content/models/{en,fr,es}/{{engine}}.json`, generates the engine/family stubs, and writes a launch packet in `docs/model-launch/{{engine}}.md`.  
- **`model:scaffold` is now a low-level helper**: use it only when you explicitly want just the JSON clone without the publication scaffolding.  
- **Treat this markdown as planning, not as the source of truth**: the production page is driven by `content/models/{locale}/{{engine}}.json`, not by `page model/{{engine}}.md`. Use this document to outline the copy, then edit the scaffolded JSON directly.  
- **Replace the borrowed content**: after scaffolding, overwrite specs, prompts, FAQs, gallery copy, compare links, and all engine-specific claims so the new page no longer describes the template model.  
- **Hook into the model page**: ensure the slug (`{{engine}}`) matches the expected path in `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/page.tsx` and any config entries.  
- **Family wiring is now the key step**: add the engine in `frontend/src/config/falEngines.ts`, set its `family`, and declare `surfaces`. If the family already exists, examples routing and the gallery resolver follow automatically. If it is a brand new family, add one entry in `frontend/config/model-families.ts` with `examplesPage.stage: "hidden"` by default so nav/sitemap/canonical exposure does not expand accidentally.  
- **Examples copy is intentionally frozen**: a model can belong to a family without changing `/examples/<family>` copy/meta. Only add the slug to `publishedModelSlugs` when you want the family landing page to mention it.  
- **Compare is intentionally manual**: routes can exist, but hub/sitemap publication only happens if `surfaces.compare.includeInHub` and `surfaces.compare.publishedPairs` are filled on purpose.  
- **Regenerate shared catalog data**: run `npm run engine:catalog` after changing `falEngines.ts` so catalog-based pages and audits see the right family metadata.  
- **Examples filter**: if you want the gallery to show relevant clips, make sure indexable videos actually use that engine/family; the examples routing now resolves by family automatically.  
- **Translations**: avoid idioms; keep sentences short to ease FR + ES localization. If you add new strings outside the JSON, update translation files accordingly.  
- **QA before publish**: run `npm run model:generate:write` then `npm run models:audit`, validate hero CTAs, compare link (if published), gallery renders, SEO/meta, and confirm that JSON-LD on `/video/[id]` pages reflects the new engine’s outputs.  
- Ensure any demo prompt has a corresponding real clip in the gallery if shown.
