# Angle Orbit visual generation log

Generated and audited on 2026-07-13 for the localized Angle landing page. All six published source photographs were created with the built-in ImageGen tool. All eight published transformed views were produced in the authenticated MaxVideoAI Angle workspace; no transformed view is an ImageGen substitute. The video-preparation pair was replaced after visual review while keeping the human-model use case, and the original cinema-camera hero was later replaced with the approved two-actor dialogue coverage sequence documented below.

## Source generation

The five non-video prompts use this exact common suffix: `landscape 4:3, no logo, no text, no watermark, subject occupies 65–75% of the frame, premium photoreal editorial photography, physically credible materials`. The replacement video-preparation prompt is recorded in full because it adds explicit pose and identity constraints.

| Section | Full ImageGen prompt | Accepted raw source | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hero | `compact professional cinema camera in black anodized aluminum with realistic optical glass, fasteners and tactile controls, centered on a sculptural ivory plinth, warm museum-gallery light. landscape 4:3, no logo, no text, no watermark, subject occupies 65–75% of the frame, premium photoreal editorial photography, physically credible materials` | `.superpowers/sdd/angle-orbit/task-4-sources/imagegen/accepted/hero-source.png` | Accepted first generation; complete camera, credible materials, no text or logo. |

| Storyboard | `solitary actor in a rust coat standing at the edge of a windswept coastal road, eye-level cinematic frame, overcast natural light. landscape 4:3, no logo, no text, no watermark, subject occupies 65–75% of the frame, premium photoreal editorial photography, physically credible materials` | `.superpowers/sdd/angle-orbit/task-4-sources/imagegen/accepted/story-source.png` | Accepted first generation; clear subject and distinct cinematic setting. |
| Ad creative | `faceted clear fragrance bottle with a deep red glass cap, straight-on campaign frame, saturated burgundy and cream set. landscape 4:3, no logo, no text, no watermark, subject occupies 65–75% of the frame, premium photoreal editorial photography, physically credible materials` | `.superpowers/sdd/angle-orbit/task-4-sources/imagegen/accepted/ad-source.png` | Accepted first generation; centered bottle, credible facets, no label text. |
| Video prep | `Use case: photorealistic-natural; Asset type: premium landing-page source image demonstrating camera-angle generation for fashion models; Primary request: create a convincing editorial first frame of one adult fashion model whose identity, outfit, pose, and environment can remain stable when a camera is rotated around them; Scene/backdrop: quiet minimalist architectural pavilion built from pale limestone, brushed steel, and tall ribbed-glass panels; clean geometric lines; no signage, no other people; Subject: one adult fashion model wearing a sculptural cobalt-blue tailored coat with distinctive ivory piping and matte black ankle boots; upright composed stance, feet planted, torso straight, one hand resting lightly on the coat lapel, other arm relaxed; calm neutral expression; face clearly visible; natural anatomy and realistic skin texture; Style/medium: premium photoreal editorial fashion photography, sophisticated contemporary campaign, physically credible fabric and materials, restrained and timeless rather than flashy; Composition/framing: landscape 4:3; eye-level front three-quarter view at roughly 10 degrees; model fills about 70 percent of the frame; full coat silhouette and nearly full body visible with no cropped hands or feet; enough architectural depth cues around the subject to make a later 45-degree camera rotation obvious; Lighting/mood: soft directional morning light with subtle shadow definition, elegant calm atmosphere, accurate skin tone and fabric texture; Color palette: cobalt blue, warm limestone, brushed silver, soft ivory, matte black; Constraints: a stable static pose suitable for viewpoint transformation; one person only; keep limbs separated and readable; no dance, no walking, no action pose, no twisted torso, no wind-blown clothing, no props, no logos, no text, no watermark, no signage, no duplicate person, no cropped limbs, no exaggerated lens distortion, no surreal geometry` | `.superpowers/sdd/angle-orbit/task-4-sources/imagegen/accepted/video-source-v2.png` | Accepted first replacement generation at 1448 × 1086; stable pose, prominent model, readable asymmetric coat piping, clean architecture, and no text or logo. |

## Post-commit visual-review remediation

The original committed hero elevated and storyboard elevated outputs were explicitly reclassified as rejected after original-detail review. The same accepted ImageGen source PNGs were re-uploaded to the authenticated Angle tool. Every retry is retained and logged below; only rows marked accepted were converted into the two replacement public WebPs.

## Hero dialogue replacement

The cinema-camera packshot was superseded on 2026-07-13 after user review. The replacement is a four-frame cinematic dialogue sequence built from one new ImageGen source and three genuine Qwen Multiple Angles transformations. The original packshot assets remain recoverable from git history; no additional public asset path was introduced.

### Replacement ImageGen source

Built-in ImageGen was called once with this full prompt:

```text
Use case: photorealistic-natural. Asset type: premium 4:3 landing-page hero source image demonstrating cinematic camera-angle generation through dialogue coverage. Primary request: create one coherent side-on master two-shot of two fictional adult actors in a quiet conversation, designed so later camera rotations can produce a clear field and reverse-field pair. Scene: a refined contemporary hotel bar at blue hour, warm amber practical lamps inside, large cool-blue window in the background, dark walnut and pale limestone materials, elegant but uncluttered, no signage and no other people. Actor A: adult woman seated screen-left, chin-length dark wavy hair, burnt-sienna tailored jacket over an ivory blouse, calm focused expression. Actor B: adult man seated screen-right, short salt-and-pepper hair, deep teal tailored jacket over a charcoal shirt, calm focused expression. Blocking: actors sit opposite each other at a small round dark-walnut table, bodies and faces in readable three-quarter profile, matching eyelines, Actor A remains screen-left and Actor B screen-right, hands separated and resting naturally, two identical clear water glasses only. Style: premium contemporary cinematic editorial photography, natural skin texture, restrained color grade, realistic fabrics and architecture, sophisticated human drama rather than advertising. Composition: landscape 4:3, medium-wide waist-up two-shot, both complete heads and shoulders comfortably inside face-safe margins, actors occupy about 70 percent of the frame together, enough depth behind each shoulder for later over-the-shoulder views, 50 mm cinema lens character, no exaggerated bokeh. Lighting: soft warm key light on both faces balanced with cool blue-hour window light, luminous and readable rather than dark. Constraints: exactly two fictional adult people, stable neutral seated poses, no celebrity likeness, no waiter, no crowd, no extra limbs, no merged hands, no duplicate props, no alcohol branding, no logo, no text, no watermark, no production equipment, no product packshot, no surreal geometry.
```

It is 1448 × 1086 and passed the pre-Angle audit for exactly two actors, two glasses, readable hands, matching eyelines, distinct wardrobe, no text, and face-safe 4:3 framing. The authenticated upload URL was `https://media.maxvideoai.com/user-assets/301cc489-d689-477f-94c4-0b051deda0bc/c36e5444-ea61-4fa7-81d3-6baf454e3ffa.png`.

### Replacement Angle generations

All attempts used Qwen Multiple Angles, safe mode, single-output generation, and the same uploaded source. The published dialogue filenames describe their editorial role and create fresh Next Image and social-card cache keys; the four superseded cinema-camera filenames were removed rather than retained as duplicates.

Original-detail review confirmed that the accepted field and reverse form an unmistakable shot/reverse-shot pair. The actors retain their hair, burnt-sienna/deep-teal wardrobe split, seated relationship, and eyelines. The elevated view preserves the same table, two glasses, chairs, and blue-hour environment without text, watermark, duplicated people, malformed hands, or furniture distortion.

## Authenticated workspace capture

The accepted hero source was loaded in `https://maxvideoai.com/app/tools/angle` with a clean FLUX 45° / 3° / 1.2 result visible. A Playwright screenshot from the authenticated Chrome tab captured page coordinates `x=215, y=180, width=1320, height=811` into `.superpowers/sdd/angle-orbit/task-4-sources/workspace/workspace-main-raw.png` (117,577 bytes). The sticky 68 px navigation strip was then removed locally, yielding the exact workspace-only source crop `left=0, top=68, width=1320, height=743` before resizing to 1600 × 900.

Privacy audit: the final crop contains the source upload, camera selector, accepted output, control values, latency/cost, and previous-job thumbnails. It contains no account menu, email address, wallet balance, sidebar, or browser chrome.

## Final conversion audit

All public assets were encoded by the installed frontend Sharp runtime as WebP at quality 82. Fourteen assets are 1600 × 1200 and the workspace capture is 1600 × 900.

The public filename `angle-orbit-video-45.webp` is retained as a stable internal asset URL even though the selected replacement was generated at 69°.

| `angle-orbit-workspace.webp` | 1600 × 900 | 76,816 |

All files are below the 500 KB hard limit. Fourteen are below the 200 KB target; `angle-orbit-proof-source.webp` is 266,278 bytes and remains below the hard limit at the required quality 82. The current dialogue hero source and three Angle outputs were inspected at original detail before conversion and again at 1600 × 1200 after WebP encoding; the field/reverse pair has stable identities, wardrobe, eyelines, and no text, watermark, malformed hands, or weak viewpoint change. The storyboard replacement remains anatomically coherent, and the replacement video pair remains prominent, consistently dressed, and posed across a clearly different viewpoint.

The first after-capture exposed a stale browser copy of the old Next Image optimization response: the public WebP and fresh server optimization both matched the new dialogue hash, while the open browser retained the old packshot under the unchanged optimized URL. The four public hero files were therefore renamed to dialogue-specific paths and the four superseded filenames were removed. Reloading then displayed the accepted `Field on Actor B` frame immediately; the automated asset contract locks these cache-invalidating paths.

Browser smoke results:

- `/tools/angle`: initial `Field on Actor B`; both buttons reached source, field, reverse, and elevated views; ArrowLeft/ArrowRight changed one stop; horizontal drags beyond 64 px changed one stop in both directions.
- `/fr/outils/angle`: initial `Champ sur l’acteur B`, next view `Contrechamp sur l’actrice A`, localized drag instruction present.
- `/es/herramientas/angle`: initial `Campo sobre el actor B`, next view `Contracampo sobre la actriz A`, localized drag instruction present.
- All routes loaded the same four dialogue assets with localized accessible names and no failed image state.

Validation results:

- Focused Node tests: 23 passed, 0 failed across `angle-orbit-assets`, `angle-orbit-state`, and `tool-marketing-landing-architecture`.
- Frontend ESLint: 0 errors and 2 unrelated pre-existing hook-dependency warnings in Studio workspace files.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `lint:exposure`: still reports pre-existing private-key fixture patterns in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-google-models-vertex-only.md` and `tests/google-vertex-auth.test.ts`; neither file is modified by this Angle work.
