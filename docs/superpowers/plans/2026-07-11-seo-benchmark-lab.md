# MaxVideoAI Benchmark Lab Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Publish a polished localized Benchmark Lab that exposes MaxVideoAI editorial scores, sourced video-model specifications, and eligible rolling latency metrics without publishing production volumes, user counts, failure counts, or success rates.

**Architecture:** Keep the public route as a thin Server Component. Version methodology in `data/benchmarks/`, read benchmark files through one cached server boundary, calculate latency through a separate read-only server module, and shape route data in route-local pure builders. Render the page with focused Server Components and reuse one shared methodology link across model and comparison score surfaces.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js App Router, React Server Components, TypeScript, PostgreSQL through `pg`, Tailwind design tokens, `next-intl` navigation, Node test runner through `tsx`.

## Global Constraints

- Work only in `/Users/adrienmillot/Desktop/MaxVideoAi V2/.worktrees/seo-benchmark-lab` on `codex/seo-benchmark-lab`.
- Preserve every current score value, model URL, comparison URL, price, refund flow, generation flow, and accessible legacy model.
- Public operational output contains only model identity, rolling-window date, median latency, and P90 latency.
- Job count, user count, failure count, success rate, and refund rate remain internal and never enter the public result type or rendered markup.
- Public refund copy is exactly equivalent to `Failed paid generations are automatically refunded.` without an admin caveat or automation percentage.
- Latency becomes public only after at least 30 completed jobs and 5 distinct non-admin users in the rolling 30-day window.
- The numeric eligibility thresholds stay server-only and are not rendered in the page methodology, empty state, markup, or copy.
- Exclude every ID in `ADMIN_EXCLUDED_USER_IDS` before aggregation.
- Use `app_jobs.updated_at - app_jobs.created_at` for end-to-end latency; do not use the partial `app_generate_metrics` completed stream.
- Use American English, French, and Latin American Spanish (`es-419`) surrounding copy.
- Keep the eight canonical benchmark prompts in English in every locale so future runs use identical instructions.
- Do not run paid benchmark generations in this lot.
- Do not add `Dataset` schema, per-model benchmark routes, new client-side state, or a public API endpoint.
- Use a six-hour page revalidation interval (`21600` seconds).
- Use existing theme tokens (`bg-bg`, `bg-surface`, `border-hairline`, `text-text-primary`, `text-text-secondary`, `text-brand`) and preserve dark mode.
- Keep every new route file focused; `page.tsx` orchestrates and route-local components own JSX sections.
- Follow TDD: failing focused test, minimal implementation, passing focused test, then commit.

### Task 1: Version the benchmark methodology and static data boundary

**Files:**
- Create: `data/benchmarks/benchmark-methodology.v1.json`
- Create: `frontend/server/benchmark-lab-data.ts`
- Create: `tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `loadBenchmarkLabStaticData(): Promise<BenchmarkLabStaticData>`
- Produces: `loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs(): Promise<Set<string>>`
- Produces: `computeBenchmarkOverall(score: BenchmarkScore): number | null`
- Consumes: existing `engine-scores.v1.json` and `engine-key-specs.v1.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing methodology contract test**

Create `tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts` with these exact assertions:

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import test from 'node:test';
import methodology from '../data/benchmarks/benchmark-methodology.v1.json' with { type: 'json' };
import scores from '../data/benchmarks/engine-scores.v1.json' with { type: 'json' };
import {
  computeBenchmarkOverall,
  loadBenchmarkLabStaticData,
  loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs,
} from '../frontend/server/benchmark-lab-data';

test('benchmark methodology is versioned and preserves the current overall formula', () => {
  assert.equal(methodology.version, '1.0.0');
  assert.equal(methodology.effectiveDate, '2026-07-11');
  assert.deepEqual(methodology.overallFormula.fields, ['fidelity', 'motion', 'consistency']);
  assert.equal(methodology.overallFormula.method, 'arithmetic_mean');
  assert.equal(methodology.overallFormula.roundToDecimals, 1);
  assert.equal(methodology.criteria.length, 11);
  assert.equal(new Set(methodology.criteria.map((criterion) => criterion.id)).size, 11);
  assert.equal(methodology.promptPack.length, 8);
  assert.ok(methodology.promptPack.every((entry) => entry.language === 'en-US'));
  assert.ok(methodology.promptPack.every((entry) => entry.prompt.length >= 120));
  assert.deepEqual(methodology.operationalLatency, {
    windowDays: 30,
    minimumCompletedJobs: 30,
    minimumDistinctUsers: 5,
    medianPercentile: 0.5,
    slowPercentile: 0.9,
  });
});

test('static loader returns the current score and specification sources unchanged', async () => {
  const data = await loadBenchmarkLabStaticData();
  assert.equal(data.scores.length, scores.scores.length);
  assert.ok(data.specs.length >= data.scores.length);
  assert.equal(data.methodology.version, '1.0.0');
  assert.equal(data.scores.find((row) => row.modelSlug === 'sora-2')?.last_updated, '2026-01-27');
});

test('overall score stays aligned with current model and compare hubs', () => {
  assert.equal(computeBenchmarkOverall({ fidelity: 8.4, motion: 7.9, consistency: 7.4 }), 7.9);
  assert.equal(computeBenchmarkOverall({ fidelity: 8.4, motion: null, consistency: undefined }), 8.4);
  assert.equal(computeBenchmarkOverall({}), null);
});

test('score slug lookup exposes the exact current editorial roster', async () => {
  const slugs = await loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs();
  assert.equal(slugs.size, scores.scores.length);
  assert.ok(slugs.has('kling-3-pro'));
  assert.ok(slugs.has('dreamina-seedance-2-0-mini'));
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and verify the missing-file failure**

Run:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because `benchmark-methodology.v1.json` and `frontend/server/benchmark-lab-data.ts` do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the exact methodology dataset**

### Task 2: Add the read-only eligible latency aggregate

**Files:**
- Create: `frontend/server/benchmark-lab-metrics.ts`
- Create: `tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `ADMIN_EXCLUDED_USER_IDS`, `listFalEngines()`, `getEngineAliases()`
- Produces: `fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency(): Promise<PublicBenchmarkLatencySnapshot>`
- Produces: `mapBenchmarkLatencyRows(rows, engines): PublicBenchmarkLatency[]`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing aggregate contract test**

Create `tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts`:

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import test from 'node:test';
import type { FalEngineEntry } from '../frontend/src/config/falEngines';
import {
  fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency,
  mapBenchmarkLatencyRows,
  type BenchmarkLatencyAggregateRow,
  type BenchmarkQuery,
} from '../frontend/server/benchmark-lab-metrics';

const engines = [
  {
    id: 'kling-3-pro',
    modelSlug: 'kling-3-pro',
    engine: { id: 'kling-3-pro', modes: ['t2v'] },
    modes: [],
    surfaces: { modelPage: { indexable: true, includeInSitemap: true } },
  },
] as unknown as FalEngineEntry[];

test('latency mapper emits only public-safe fields for mapped models', () => {
  const rows: BenchmarkLatencyAggregateRow[] = [
    {
      engine_id: 'kling-3-pro',
      completed_count: 104,
      distinct_users: 28,
      median_duration_ms: 230800,
      p90_duration_ms: 451600,
      as_of: '2026-07-11T14:00:00.000Z',
    },
    {
      engine_id: 'unknown-engine',
      completed_count: 80,
      distinct_users: 20,
      median_duration_ms: 100000,
      p90_duration_ms: 200000,
      as_of: '2026-07-11T14:00:00.000Z',

    },
  ]);
  assert.equal('completedCount' in mapped[0]!, false);
  assert.equal('distinctUsers' in mapped[0]!, false);
  assert.equal('successRate' in mapped[0]!, false);
});

test('latency query applies internal thresholds and admin exclusions', async () => {
  let capturedSql = '';
  let capturedParams: readonly unknown[] = [];
  const queryFn: BenchmarkQuery = async <T>(sql: string, params?: readonly unknown[]) => {
    capturedSql = sql;
    capturedParams = params ?? [];
    return [] as T[];
  };

  const snapshot = await fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency({
    queryFn,
    databaseConfigured: true,
    engines,
  });

  assert.equal(snapshot.status, 'available');
  assert.deepEqual(snapshot.rows, []);
  assert.match(capturedSql, /COUNT\(\*\) >= \$4/);
  assert.match(capturedSql, /COUNT\(DISTINCT user_id\) >= \$5/);
  assert.match(capturedSql, /user_id <> ALL\(\$1::text\[\]\)/);
  assert.equal(capturedParams[1], 30);
  assert.equal(capturedParams[3], 30);
  assert.equal(capturedParams[4], 5);
});

test('missing database returns unavailable rather than zero metrics', async () => {
  const snapshot = await fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency({
    databaseConfigured: false,
    engines,
  });
  assert.deepEqual(snapshot, { status: 'unavailable', windowDays: 30, asOf: null, rows: [] });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and verify failure**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because `benchmark-lab-metrics.ts` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the read-only aggregate**

Create `frontend/server/benchmark-lab-metrics.ts` with this contract and query:

```ts
import { getEngineAliases, listFalEngines, type FalEngineEntry } from '@/config/falEngines';
import { isDatabaseConfigured, query } from '@/lib/db';
import { ADMIN_EXCLUDED_USER_IDS } from '@/lib/admin/exclusions';

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the focused test**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts
```

Expected: 3 tests pass, 0 fail.

- [ ] **Step 5: Verify the real aggregate without exposing identifiers**

Run from `frontend/` with the root environment file:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tsx --env-file='/Users/adrienmillot/Desktop/MaxVideoAi V2/frontend/.env.local' --tsconfig=tsconfig.json -e "import { fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency } from './server/benchmark-lab-metrics.ts'; void (async () => { const snapshot = await fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency(); console.log(JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 2)); })();"
```

Expected: `status` is `available`; every row contains only `engineId`, `modelSlug`, `medianDurationMs`, `p90DurationMs`, and `asOf`; no row contains counts or rates.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit the latency boundary**

```bash
git add frontend/server/benchmark-lab-metrics.ts tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: add public benchmark latency snapshot"
```

### Task 3: Build the localized route foundation and page data

**Files:**
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/page.tsx`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_lib/benchmark-copy.ts`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_lib/benchmark-page-data.ts`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_lib/benchmark-schema.ts`
- Modify: `frontend/next-sitemap.config.js`
- Create: `tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `loadBenchmarkLabStaticData()`, `fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency()`
- Produces: `getBenchmarkCopy(locale): BenchmarkCopy`
- Produces: `buildBenchmarkPageData(staticData, latency): BenchmarkPageData`
- Produces: `buildBenchmarkWebPageJsonLd()` and `buildBenchmarkBreadcrumbJsonLd()`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing route architecture and copy test**

Create `tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts` with route, copy, privacy, and schema checks:

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert/strict';
import { existsSync, readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import test from 'node:test';
import { buildBenchmarkPageData } from '../frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_lib/benchmark-page-data';
import { getBenchmarkCopy } from '../frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_lib/benchmark-copy';
import { loadBenchmarkLabStaticData } from '../frontend/server/benchmark-lab-data';

const routeRoot = 'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks';
const pagePath = path.join(routeRoot, 'page.tsx');

test('benchmark lab route stays a thin localized server orchestrator', () => {
  assert.ok(existsSync(pagePath));
  const source = readFileSync(pagePath, 'utf8');
  assert.match(source, /export const revalidate = 21600/);
  assert.match(source, /englishPath: '\/benchmarks'/);
  assert.match(source, /loadBenchmarkLabStaticData/);
  assert.match(source, /fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency/);
  assert.match(source, /BenchmarkLabView/);
  assert.doesNotMatch(source, /FROM app_jobs|PERCENTILE_CONT|scores\.map|specs\.map/);
  assert.ok(source.split('\n').length <= 120);
});

test('benchmark copy is complete in American English, French, and Latin American Spanish', () => {
  for (const locale of ['en', 'fr', 'es'] as const) {
    const copy = getBenchmarkCopy(locale);
    assert.ok(copy.meta.title.length >= 30);
    assert.ok(copy.hero.title.length >= 20);
    assert.equal(copy.refundNote.length > 0, true);
    assert.equal(copy.scoreLabels.length, 11);
    assert.equal(Object.keys(copy.methodology.criteria).length, 11);
    assert.equal(copy.methodology.methodNotes.length, 5);
  }
  assert.equal(getBenchmarkCopy('en').refundNote, 'Failed paid generations are automatically refunded.');
  assert.match(getBenchmarkCopy('es').hero.intro, /modelos de video/i);
});

test('page builder keeps production volumes and rates out of public data', () => {
  const pageData = buildBenchmarkPageData(
    {
      scores: [{ modelSlug: 'kling-3-pro', fidelity: 8.6, motion: 8.4, consistency: 8.0 }],
      specs: [{ modelSlug: 'kling-3-pro', sources: ['https://fal.ai/models/kling'], keySpecs: { maxDuration: '15s', maxResolution: '1080p' } }],

        criteria: [], promptPack: [], requiredRunMetadata: [],
        operationalLatency: { windowDays: 30, minimumCompletedJobs: 30, minimumDistinctUsers: 5, medianPercentile: 0.5, slowPercentile: 0.9 },
        limitations: [], changelog: [],
      },
    },
    { status: 'available', windowDays: 30, asOf: '2026-07-11T14:00:00.000Z', rows: [{ engineId: 'kling-3-pro', modelSlug: 'kling-3-pro', medianDurationMs: 230800, p90DurationMs: 451600, asOf: '2026-07-11T14:00:00.000Z' }] }
  );
  assert.equal(pageData.scores[0]?.overall, 8.3);
  assert.equal(pageData.latency.rows[0]?.medianDurationMs, 230800);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('successRate'), false);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('completedJobs'), false);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('distinctUsers'), false);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('minimumCompletedJobs'), false);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('minimumDistinctUsers'), false);
  assert.equal(JSON.stringify(pageData).includes('sampleSize'), false);
});

test('page builder preserves the complete editorial roster, including legacy video models', async () => {
  const staticData = await loadBenchmarkLabStaticData();
  const pageData = buildBenchmarkPageData(staticData, { status: 'unavailable', windowDays: 30, asOf: null, rows: [] });
  assert.equal(pageData.scores.length, staticData.scores.length);
  assert.ok(pageData.scores.some((row) => row.modelSlug === 'ltx-2'));
});

test('localized sitemap generation includes the benchmark hub', () => {
  const sitemapSource = readFileSync('frontend/next-sitemap.config.js', 'utf8');
  assert.match(sitemapSource, /MARKETING_CORE_PATHS[\s\S]*['"]\/benchmarks['"]/);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and verify missing-module failures**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because the route-local modules do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the exact localized copy contract**

In `_lib/benchmark-copy.ts`, define `BenchmarkCopy` and all three locale entries. Use these exact public headlines and messages:

```ts
import type { AppLocale } from '@/i18n/locales';

export type BenchmarkCopy = {

export function getBenchmarkCopy(locale: AppLocale): BenchmarkCopy {
  return {
    ...(COPY[locale] ?? COPY.en),
    scoreLabels: SCORE_IDS.map((id, index) => ({ id, label: SCORE_LABELS[locale][index] ?? SCORE_LABELS.en[index]! })),
  };
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the pure page-data builder**

In `_lib/benchmark-page-data.ts`, define plain row types and implement these rules:

```ts
import { listFalEngines } from '@/config/falEngines';
import { supportsVideoGeneration } from '@/lib/models/catalog';
import { computeBenchmarkOverall, type BenchmarkLabStaticData, type BenchmarkScore } from '@/server/benchmark-lab-data';
import type { PublicBenchmarkLatencySnapshot } from '@/server/benchmark-lab-metrics';

const METRIC_IDS = ['fidelity', 'visualQuality', 'motion', 'consistency', 'anatomy', 'textRendering', 'lipsyncQuality', 'sequencingQuality', 'controllability', 'speedStability', 'pricing'] as const;

export type BenchmarkScoreRow = {
  modelSlug: string;
  modelName: string;
  overall: number | null;
  updatedAt: string | null;
  metrics: Record<(typeof METRIC_IDS)[number], number | null>;
};

export type BenchmarkSpecRow = {
  modelSlug: string;
  modelName: string;
  maxDuration: string;
  maxResolution: string;
  inputModes: Array<'textToVideo' | 'imageToVideo' | 'videoToVideo'>;
  audio: string;
  references: string;
  sourceUrl: string | null;
};

export type PublicBenchmarkMethodology = Pick<
  BenchmarkLabStaticData['methodology'],
  'version' | 'effectiveDate' | 'scoreScale' | 'overallFormula' | 'criteria' | 'promptPack' | 'limitations' | 'changelog'
>;

export type BenchmarkPageData = {
  scores: BenchmarkScoreRow[];
  specs: BenchmarkSpecRow[];
  methodology: PublicBenchmarkMethodology;
  latency: PublicBenchmarkLatencySnapshot;
};

function value(value: unknown): string {
  return value == null || String(value).trim() === '' ? '—' : String(value).trim();
}

function isSupported(value: unknown): boolean {
  return /^supported\b|^yes$|^true$/i.test(value == null ? '' : String(value).trim());
}

function metricMap(score: BenchmarkScore): BenchmarkScoreRow['metrics'] {
  return Object.fromEntries(METRIC_IDS.map((id) => [id, typeof score[id] === 'number' ? score[id] : null])) as BenchmarkScoreRow['metrics'];
}

export function buildBenchmarkPageData(
  staticData: BenchmarkLabStaticData,
  latency: PublicBenchmarkLatencySnapshot
): BenchmarkPageData {
  const engines = listFalEngines().filter((engine) => supportsVideoGeneration(engine));
  const engineBySlug = new Map(engines.map((engine) => [engine.modelSlug, engine]));
  const scoreBySlug = new Map(staticData.scores.map((score) => [score.modelSlug ?? score.engineId ?? '', score]));
  const scores = staticData.scores.flatMap((score) => {
    const modelSlug = score.modelSlug ?? score.engineId;
    const engine = modelSlug ? engineBySlug.get(modelSlug) : null;
    if (!modelSlug || !engine) return [];
    return [{ modelSlug, modelName: engine.marketingName, overall: computeBenchmarkOverall(score), updatedAt: score.last_updated ?? null, metrics: metricMap(score) }];
  }).sort((left, right) => (right.overall ?? -1) - (left.overall ?? -1) || left.modelName.localeCompare(right.modelName));

  const specs = staticData.specs.flatMap((spec) => {
    const modelSlug = spec.modelSlug ?? spec.engineId;
    const engine = modelSlug ? engineBySlug.get(modelSlug) : null;
    const score = modelSlug ? scoreBySlug.get(modelSlug) : null;
    if (!modelSlug || !engine || !score || !spec.keySpecs) return [];
    const inputModes = [
      isSupported(spec.keySpecs.textToVideo) ? 'textToVideo' : null,
      isSupported(spec.keySpecs.imageToVideo) ? 'imageToVideo' : null,
      isSupported(spec.keySpecs.videoToVideo) ? 'videoToVideo' : null,
    ].filter((entry): entry is 'textToVideo' | 'imageToVideo' | 'videoToVideo' => Boolean(entry));
    return [{
      modelSlug,
      modelName: engine.marketingName,
      maxDuration: value(spec.keySpecs.maxDuration),
      maxResolution: value(spec.keySpecs.maxResolution),
      inputModes,
      audio: value(spec.keySpecs.nativeAudioGeneration ?? spec.keySpecs.audioOutput),
      references: value(spec.keySpecs.referenceImageStyle ?? spec.keySpecs.referenceVideo),
      sourceUrl: spec.sources?.find((url) => !url.includes('maxvideoai.com')) ?? spec.sources?.[0] ?? null,
    }];
  }).sort((left, right) => left.modelName.localeCompare(right.modelName));

  const methodology: PublicBenchmarkMethodology = {
    version: staticData.methodology.version,
    effectiveDate: staticData.methodology.effectiveDate,
    scoreScale: staticData.methodology.scoreScale,
    overallFormula: staticData.methodology.overallFormula,
    criteria: staticData.methodology.criteria,
    promptPack: staticData.methodology.promptPack,
    limitations: staticData.methodology.limitations,
    changelog: staticData.methodology.changelog,
  };

  return { scores, specs, methodology, latency };
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Implement schema builders and the route wrapper**

Use `buildSeoMetadata({ locale, englishPath: '/benchmarks', titleBranding: 'none' })`, `buildMetadataUrls()`, `JsonLd`, and `localeRegions`. Preserve the shared SEO convention: reciprocal hreflang keys are generic `en`, `fr`, and `es`, plus `x-default`; Open Graph locales are `en_US`, `fr_FR`, and `es_419`, while schema language values use the corresponding regional BCP 47 values. Keep the exact public URLs `/benchmarks`, `/fr/benchmarks`, and `/es/benchmarks`. The complete route wrapper must stay equivalent to:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import type { AppLocale } from '@/i18n/locales';
import { localeRegions } from '@/i18n/locales';
import { JsonLd } from '@/components/SeoJsonLd';
import { buildMetadataUrls } from '@/lib/metadataUrls';
import { buildSeoMetadata } from '@/lib/seo/metadata';
import { loadBenchmarkLabStaticData } from '@/server/benchmark-lab-data';
import { fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency } from '@/server/benchmark-lab-metrics';
import { BenchmarkLabView } from './_components/BenchmarkLabView';
import { getBenchmarkCopy } from './_lib/benchmark-copy';
import { buildBenchmarkPageData } from './_lib/benchmark-page-data';
import { buildBenchmarkBreadcrumbJsonLd, buildBenchmarkWebPageJsonLd } from './_lib/benchmark-schema';

export const revalidate = 21600;

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: Promise<{ locale: AppLocale }> }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { locale } = await params;
  const copy = getBenchmarkCopy(locale);
  return buildSeoMetadata({
    locale,
    englishPath: '/benchmarks',
    title: copy.meta.title,
    description: copy.meta.description,
    titleBranding: 'none',
    keywords: ['AI video benchmarks', 'AI video model scores', 'AI video generation speed', 'MaxVideoAI methodology'],
    imageAlt: copy.hero.title,
  });
}

export default async function BenchmarkLabPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ locale: AppLocale }> }) {
  const { locale } = await params;
  const copy = getBenchmarkCopy(locale);
  const [staticData, latency] = await Promise.all([loadBenchmarkLabStaticData(), fetchPublicBenchmarkLatency()]);
  const data = buildBenchmarkPageData(staticData, latency);
  const canonicalUrl = buildMetadataUrls(locale, undefined, { englishPath: '/benchmarks' }).canonical;
  return (
    <>
      <JsonLd json={buildBenchmarkWebPageJsonLd({ canonicalUrl, copy, inLanguage: localeRegions[locale], modifiedAt: data.methodology.effectiveDate })} />
      <JsonLd json={buildBenchmarkBreadcrumbJsonLd({ canonicalUrl, copy })} />
      <BenchmarkLabView copy={copy} data={data} locale={locale} />
    </>
  );
}
```

`benchmark-schema.ts` must build only `WebPage` and `BreadcrumbList`, with MaxVideoAI as publisher and no `Dataset` payload. Add `'/benchmarks'` to `MARKETING_CORE_PATHS` in `frontend/next-sitemap.config.js`; the existing localized sitemap expansion will then emit the English, French, and Spanish URLs.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add a temporary view contract so the route compiles**

Create `_components/BenchmarkLabView.tsx` as a minimal Server Component returning the hero title and section anchors. Task 4 replaces the minimal markup without changing its props:

```tsx
import type { AppLocale } from '@/i18n/locales';
import type { BenchmarkCopy } from '../_lib/benchmark-copy';
import type { BenchmarkPageData } from '../_lib/benchmark-page-data';

export function BenchmarkLabView({ copy }: { copy: BenchmarkCopy; data: BenchmarkPageData; locale: AppLocale }) {
  return <main><h1>{copy.hero.title}</h1></main>;
}
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Run route and data tests**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts
```

Expected: all focused tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit the route foundation**

```bash
git add 'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks' frontend/next-sitemap.config.js tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: add benchmark lab route foundation"
```

---

### Task 4: Build the polished responsive Benchmark Lab presentation

**Files:**
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_components/BenchmarkLabView.tsx`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_components/BenchmarkScoreTable.tsx`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_components/BenchmarkSpecsTable.tsx`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_components/BenchmarkLatencySection.tsx`
- Create: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/_components/BenchmarkMethodologySection.tsx`
- Modify: `tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `BenchmarkPageData`, `BenchmarkCopy`, `AppLocale`
- Produces: one server-rendered, no-client-JavaScript research page

### Visual contract

- Hero: quiet research aesthetic, subtle brand-blue radial glow, small `MaxVideoAI Research` eyebrow, 48–64px headline, restrained proof line.
- Evidence strip: three equal cards for editorial scores, sourced specs, and observed speed. The first two cards may display the dynamic model-row counts (`data.scores.length` and `data.specs.length`); never display generation, job, or user counts.
- Anchor navigation: sticky-under-header pill bar linking `#scorecards`, `#specifications`, `#observed-speed`, and `#methodology`.
- Score matrix: rounded 24px surface, sticky model column, compact 0–10 cells, thin horizontal score bars, horizontal touch scrolling, no chart library.
- Specs matrix: separate semantic table so facts never look like editorial grades.
- Latency: two-number cards per eligible model, large median, quieter P90, no counts or rates.
- Methodology: formula card, criterion grid, eight native `<details>` prompt accordions, method notes, changelog.
- CTA: compact four-link footer card; it must not compete with the research content.
- Mobile: no clipped text, tables scroll inside their own containers, tap targets at least 40px, sticky first column remains readable.
- Dark mode: use existing tokens and translucent neutral surfaces; no light-only hard-coded backgrounds.

- [ ] **Step 1: Strengthen the failing visual architecture test**

Append to `tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts`:

```ts
test('benchmark lab presentation stays split into focused server components', () => {
  const components = ['BenchmarkLabView', 'BenchmarkScoreTable', 'BenchmarkSpecsTable', 'BenchmarkLatencySection', 'BenchmarkMethodologySection'];
  for (const component of components) {
    const file = path.join(routeRoot, '_components', `${component}.tsx`);
    assert.ok(existsSync(file), `${component} should exist`);
    const source = readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    assert.doesNotMatch(source, /['\"]use client['\"]/);
  }
  const view = readFileSync(path.join(routeRoot, '_components/BenchmarkLabView.tsx'), 'utf8');
  const scoreTable = readFileSync(path.join(routeRoot, '_components/BenchmarkScoreTable.tsx'), 'utf8');
  const specsTable = readFileSync(path.join(routeRoot, '_components/BenchmarkSpecsTable.tsx'), 'utf8');
  const methodology = readFileSync(path.join(routeRoot, '_components/BenchmarkMethodologySection.tsx'), 'utf8');
  assert.match(view, /id="scorecards"/);
  assert.match(view, /id="specifications"/);
  assert.match(view, /id="observed-speed"/);
  assert.match(view, /id="methodology"/);
  assert.match(scoreTable, /overflow-x-auto/);
  assert.match(specsTable, /overflow-x-auto/);
  assert.match(view, /Failed paid generations are automatically refunded\.|refundNote/);
  assert.doesNotMatch(view, /success rate|generation count|distinct users|failed jobs refunded/i);
  assert.doesNotMatch(methodology, /minimumCompletedJobs|minimumDistinctUsers|sampleSize/);
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the test and verify missing component failures**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL for the four missing focused section components.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the score and specification tables**

`BenchmarkScoreTable` must render a semantic `<table className="min-w-[1180px]">` inside `overflow-x-auto`, keep the model cell `sticky left-0`, link each model name with the localized `Link` route `{ pathname: '/models/[slug]', params: { slug: row.modelSlug } }`, render overall as a brand score badge, render each metric as a number plus a CSS width bar, format recorded dates for `locale`, and omit a date when `updatedAt` is null.

`BenchmarkSpecsTable` must render a separate `<table className="min-w-[980px]">` with columns for model, max duration, max resolution, input modes, audio, references, and one external source link. Link model names through the same localized model route, map each `inputModes` key through `copy.specs.modeLabels`, and use `rel="noreferrer"` plus an `ExternalLink` icon on source links.

The score cell implementation must use this deterministic bar width:

```tsx
function ScoreValue({ value }: { value: number | null }) {
  if (value == null) return <span className="text-text-muted">—</span>;
  const width = `${Math.max(0, Math.min(100, value * 10))}%`;
  return (
    <div className="min-w-[72px]">
      <span className="text-sm font-semibold tabular-nums text-text-primary">{value.toFixed(1)}</span>
      <span className="mt-1 block h-1 overflow-hidden rounded-full bg-surface-subtle">
        <span className="block h-full rounded-full bg-brand/70" style={{ width }} />
      </span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement latency and methodology sections**

`BenchmarkLatencySection` renders nothing numerical when `status === 'unavailable'`; it shows the localized refresh copy. For available rows it resolves the display name from the matching `BenchmarkScoreRow`, links it to the localized model route, formats milliseconds with `Intl.NumberFormat` into `Xm Ys` or `Ys`, and renders only model name, median, P90, rolling-window label, and `asOf` date. When the snapshot is available but has no eligible rows, render `copy.latency.more` with no empty zero values.

`BenchmarkMethodologySection` must:

- show `(${copy.methodology.criteria.fidelity.label} + ${copy.methodology.criteria.motion.label} + ${copy.methodology.criteria.consistency.label}) ÷ 3` in a dedicated formula card so the formula is localized without changing its fields;
- map every methodology criterion into a compact definition card using `copy.methodology.criteria[criterion.id]` for the localized label and definition;
- render eight `<details>` accordions with the unchanged English prompt text;
- show `copy.methodology.canonicalPrompt` on every prompt;
- leave `operationalLatency.minimumCompletedJobs`, `operationalLatency.minimumDistinctUsers`, and the `sampleSize` entry from `requiredRunMetadata` out of rendered copy and markup;
- render `copy.methodology.methodNotes` and pair each methodology changelog date/version with `copy.methodology.initialRelease`, without unfinished markers, test claims, or missing-data warnings.

- [ ] **Step 5: Replace the temporary view with the complete visual composition**

`BenchmarkLabView` must compose the hero, three evidence cards, anchor navigation, score table, specs table, latency cards, method section, refund note, and CTA. Use `overflow-x-clip bg-bg text-text-primary` on the outer `<main>`, `relative overflow-hidden border-b border-hairline px-4 py-16 sm:px-8 sm:py-24` on the hero, `sticky top-[var(--header-height)] z-20 border-b border-hairline bg-bg/90 backdrop-blur` on the anchor navigation, and `container-page max-w-[1240px] space-y-16 py-10 sm:space-y-24 sm:py-16` on the content wrapper.

Use `FlaskConical`, `Gauge`, `ShieldCheck`, `Database`, `Clock3`, `ExternalLink`, and `ArrowRight` only through `UIIcon` or direct Lucide components with `aria-hidden`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run focused tests and lint the route**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts
pnpm --prefix frontend exec eslint 'app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks/**/*.{ts,tsx}' --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern
```

Expected: all tests pass and ESLint reports 0 errors.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit the presentation**

```bash
git add 'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks' tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: design benchmark lab presentation"
```

### Task 5: Link the methodology from existing score surfaces

**Files:**
- Create: `frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/ai-video-engines/[slug]/_components/CompareScorecardSection.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/ai-video-engines/[slug]/_components/CompareDetailContent.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/page.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/_components/MarketingModelPageLayout.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/_components/ModelSpecsSection.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/ModelsCatalogPage.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/_components/ModelsCatalogRecommendedSection.tsx`
- Modify: `frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/ai-video-engines/page.tsx`
- Modify: `tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts`
- Modify: `tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts`
- Modify: `tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts`
- Modify: `tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `<BenchmarkMethodologyLink locale variant />`
- Consumes: `localizePathFromEnglish(locale, '/benchmarks')`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing shared-link integration assertions**

Add source-contract assertions:

```ts
assert.match(scorecardSectionSource, /BenchmarkMethodologyLink/);
assert.match(scorecardSectionSource, /activeLocale/);
```

to `tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts`.

Add:

```ts
const modelPageSource = readSource(path.join(root, 'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/page.tsx'));
assert.match(modelPageSource, /loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs/);
assert.match(layoutSource, /showBenchmarkLink/);
assert.match(readSource(path.join(root, 'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/_components/ModelSpecsSection.tsx')), /BenchmarkMethodologyLink/);
```

to `tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts`.

Add:

```ts
assert.match(recommendedSource, /BenchmarkMethodologyLink/);
assert.match(pageSource, /locale=\{activeLocale\}/);
```

to `tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts`.

Add a benchmark route assertion that `frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx` includes `/benchmarks`, `en`, `fr`, and `es` labels.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the four test files and verify failures**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts
```

Expected: FAIL because the shared component and integrations do not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create the shared localized methodology link**

Create `frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx`:

```tsx
import clsx from 'clsx';
import { FlaskConical } from 'lucide-react';
import type { AppLocale } from '@/i18n/locales';
import { Link } from '@/i18n/navigation';
import { localizePathFromEnglish } from '@/lib/i18n/paths';

const LABELS: Record<AppLocale, string> = {
  en: 'How we benchmark',
  fr: 'Notre méthodologie',
  es: 'Cómo evaluamos',
};

export function BenchmarkMethodologyLink({
  locale,
  variant = 'inline',
  className,
}: {
  locale: AppLocale;
  variant?: 'inline' | 'pill';
  className?: string;
}) {
  return (
    <Link
      href={localizePathFromEnglish(locale, '/benchmarks')}
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 font-semibold text-brand transition hover:text-brandHover focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring',
        variant === 'pill' && 'min-h-10 rounded-full border border-brand/20 bg-brand/5 px-3 text-xs',
        variant === 'inline' && 'text-xs underline-offset-4 hover:underline',
        className
      )}
    >
      <FlaskConical className="h-3.5 w-3.5" aria-hidden />
      {LABELS[locale]}
    </Link>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the link to comparison score surfaces**

Add `activeLocale: AppLocale` to `CompareScorecardSectionProps`, render `<BenchmarkMethodologyLink locale={activeLocale} className="mt-3" />` under the scorecard subtitle, and pass `activeLocale` from `CompareDetailContent`.

On the comparison hub, render `<BenchmarkMethodologyLink locale={locale} variant="pill" />` directly below `CompareNowWidget`, centered with the quick-start links.

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the link to model score surfaces without linking image-only pages**

In the existing async `renderMarketingModelPage()` function in `models/[slug]/page.tsx`, call the cached `loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs()` after `isVideoEngine` is known, then compute:

```ts
const benchmarkScoreSlugs = await loadBenchmarkScoreSlugs();
const showBenchmarkLink = isVideoEngine && benchmarkScoreSlugs.has(engine.modelSlug);
```

Pass `showBenchmarkLink` into `MarketingModelPageLayout`. The layout must remain synchronous: accept the boolean prop, include it in `specsProps`, and perform no filesystem or server-data reads. Extend `ModelSpecsSectionProps` with `showBenchmarkLink?: boolean` and render `<BenchmarkMethodologyLink locale={locale} variant="pill" />` in both the decision and default spec section headers when true.

Pass `locale={activeLocale}` into `ModelsCatalogRecommendedSection` and render the pill link beside the existing `See all models` action because that section visibly displays overall scores. Do not add it to image-only cards.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run focused integration tests**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts
```

Expected: all focused integration and architecture tests pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit the methodology links**

```bash
git add frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/ai-video-engines' \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models' \
  tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts \
  tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts
git commit -m "feat: link score surfaces to benchmark methodology"
```

### Task 6: Verify SEO, privacy, responsive design, and full regression safety

**Files:**
- Modify only if verification finds a defect in files already listed above.

**Interfaces:**
- Verifies the completed feature; introduces no new public behavior.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the focused Benchmark Lab suite**

```bash
pnpm exec tsx --tsconfig frontend/tsconfig.json --test \
  tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts \
  tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts \
  tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts \
  tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts \
  tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts \
  tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts \
  tests/schema-sitemap-architecture.test.ts
```

Expected: all tests pass, 0 fail.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run static exposure and formatting guards**

```bash
pnpm --prefix frontend run lint
pnpm run lint:exposure
git diff --check origin/main...HEAD
```

Expected: all commands exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the full validation suite**

```bash
pnpm test:validate
```

Expected: at least 1,771 tests pass plus the new Benchmark Lab tests, 0 fail. If the suite regenerates the two comparison indexation matrix artifacts, restore only those generated files before final review and do not commit them.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build the production application**

```bash
pnpm --prefix frontend run build
```

Expected: build and postbuild sitemap generation exit 0. Confirm the build output lists the localized Benchmark Lab route without a server/client boundary error.

- [ ] **Step 5: Start a local production server for browser QA**

```bash
pnpm --prefix frontend run start -- --port 3100
```

Use the browser to inspect:

- `http://localhost:3100/benchmarks`
- `http://localhost:3100/fr/benchmarks`
- `http://localhost:3100/es/benchmarks`
- one scored model page in each locale;
- one comparison page in each locale;
- the models hub and comparison hub.

Expected visual results:

- hero hierarchy is balanced at 390px, 768px, 1280px, and 1440px widths;
- no table escapes its rounded scroll container;
- sticky model columns remain readable in light and dark themes;
- score bars and numeric values remain aligned;
- latency cards expose no sample, user, failure, success, or refund rate;
- canonical prompt accordions display unchanged English prompt text in every locale;
- the refund sentence is direct and contains no admin or percentage caveat;
- shared methodology links are visible but secondary to the primary task;
- keyboard Tab order reaches anchor navigation, source links, prompt accordions, and CTAs;
- no horizontal page-level scrollbar appears.

- [ ] **Step 6: Inspect metadata, JSON-LD, and sitemap output**

For each locale route, verify:

- self-canonical URL;
- reciprocal `en`, `fr`, `es`, and `x-default` hreflang values, with regional `en_US`, `fr_FR`, and `es_419` Open Graph locales and corresponding regional schema language values;
- `index,follow` behavior;
- one `WebPage` and one `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD payload;
- no `Dataset` payload;
- inclusion in the matching localized sitemap;
- no changes to existing model or comparison sitemap entries.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run a public-data string audit**

```bash
rg -n -i "success rate|failed jobs|distinct users|completed jobs|sample size|minimumCompletedJobs|minimumDistinctUsers|admin refund|manual refund" \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks' \
  frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx
```

Expected: no public UI copy or component prop exposes production volumes, rates, eligibility thresholds, or admin refund language. The future-run `sampleSize` requirement may exist only in the versioned data file and server-side static type; it does not enter `BenchmarkPageData` or rendered markup.

- [ ] **Step 8: Review the final diff and commit any verification-only correction**

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD
git diff --check origin/main...HEAD
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
```

Expected: only the Benchmark Lab plan, data, route, shared link, focused integrations, and tests are present. If QA required a correction, commit it with:

```bash
git add data/benchmarks/benchmark-methodology.v1.json \
  frontend/server/benchmark-lab-data.ts frontend/server/benchmark-lab-metrics.ts \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/benchmarks' \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/ai-video-engines' \
  'frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models' \
  frontend/next-sitemap.config.js \
  frontend/components/marketing/BenchmarkMethodologyLink.tsx \
  tests/benchmark-lab-data.test.ts tests/benchmark-lab-metrics.test.ts \
  tests/benchmark-lab-route.test.ts tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts \
  tests/model-page-layout-architecture.test.ts tests/models-catalog-architecture.test.ts
git commit -m "fix: polish benchmark lab verification"
```

Do not push, merge, or delete the branch until the user explicitly approves the completed implementation.
