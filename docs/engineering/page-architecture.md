# Page Architecture Guide

This guide defines the target architecture for large Next.js pages in MaxVideoAI.

## Target Responsibility Split

A page should answer four questions:

1. Who can view this route?
2. Which canonical route/data does it represent?
3. Which data does the route need?
4. Which sections make up the rendered page?

Everything else should usually live outside `page.tsx`.

## Server Page Pattern

Use this for marketing, SEO, model, comparison, docs, examples, legal, and admin server pages.

```tsx
export async function generateMetadata(props: PageProps): Promise<Metadata> {
  const params = await props.params;
  return buildFeatureMetadata(params);
}

export default async function Page(props: PageProps) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const model = await resolveFeaturePageData(params);

  if (!model) {
    notFound();
  }

  return <FeaturePageShell model={model} />;
}
```

Move these out of `page.tsx` when they grow:

- JSON-LD builders
- SEO title/description mapping
- pricing/spec calculations
- localized label maps
- repeated JSX sections
- example/gallery transformation
- comparison/scoring helpers

## Client Page Pattern

Use this for dashboard, workspace, app, billing, login, settings, and library pages.

Prefer:

```tsx
export default function DashboardPage() {
  const dashboard = useDashboardPage();

  return (
    <DashboardShell>
      <CreateHero {...dashboard.createHero} />
      <InProgressPanel {...dashboard.inProgress} />
      <RecentGrid {...dashboard.recent} />
    </DashboardShell>
  );
}
```

Extract client pages in this order:

1. constants and copy defaults
2. browser storage helpers
3. data/state hooks
4. self-contained panels/cards
5. heavy optional UI with `next/dynamic`

## Data Builder Pattern

When a route has many derived props, create a builder:

```txt
_lib/
  build-model-page-data.ts
```

The builder should return plain data. It should not return JSX.

This makes the route easier to inspect and makes unit testing possible.

## Section Component Pattern

Large JSX blocks should become named components with narrow props:

```tsx
export function ModelPricingSection({ pricing, labels }: ModelPricingSectionProps) {
  return <section>{/* rendering only */}</section>;
}
```

Avoid passing the entire dictionary or entire engine object unless the section truly needs it.

## JSON-LD Pattern

Build schema payloads in pure helpers, then render them at the route/shell level:

```tsx
const schemas = buildModelSchemas(modelPageData);

return schemas.map((schema, index) => (
  <script
    key={index}
    type="application/ld+json"
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: serializeJsonLd(schema) }}
  />
));
```

Keep serialization centralized to avoid inconsistent escaping.

## Localized Comparison Content

Enriched comparison editorial content, including slug-specific metadata, is owned by
`content/comparisons/<canonical-slug>.json`. Each document contains one `slug` plus complete
`en`, `fr`, and `es` projections. Keep those locale projections structurally aligned and edit
them together; do not add locale-specific TypeScript maps, an English fallback, a generated
registry, or direct JSON imports in routes.

Routes and metadata builders consume document-backed content through:

```ts
getComparePageOverride(locale, canonicalSlug)
```

Comparisons without a content document intentionally use the generic renderer and may keep
slug-specific SEO fallback metadata in `compareCopy.meta.slugOverrides` in the locale message
files. A canonical slug must never exist in both a comparison document and `slugOverrides`.
New or edited documents must pass `tests/comparison-content-contract.test.ts`, including the
dynamic generic-fallback inventory, empty-intersection, identity, schema, locale parity, link,
and path-safety contracts. The complementary `tests/compare-page-architecture.test.ts` owns
route isolation, obsolete-source absence, and Next output-tracing contracts.

## Localized Model Decision Content

`content/models/{locale}/{slug}.json` is the only localized editorial owner for model pages.
Every template-configured model requires a strict top-level `decision` block in English,
French, and Spanish.

`getEngineLocalized` selects `decision` only from the requested locale; it never falls back to
English. `model-page-decision-content.ts` validates the editorial copy and hrefs, while
`model-page-decision-data.ts` adds scenarios backed by live pricing.

Do not add TypeScript copy maps, a second filesystem loader, direct JSON imports, or numeric
prices to decision content.

## Localized Model Examples Content

Model-specific Examples editorial copy lives only in
`content/models/{locale}/{slug}.json#examples`. The model loader selects the exact requested
locale and never falls back to English for this block. The strict parser, pure view-model
builder, and focused server/client renderers must remain model-neutral; do not add slug-specific
editorial branches or reads from `custom` gallery fields.

Every strict `examples` block owns a required `showWhenEmpty` boolean. Keep it aligned across
EN, FR, and ES. The view-model stays visible when final real/fallback items exist, or when
`showWhenEmpty` is true for authored empty-state copy; it must not infer this from model identity.

Runtime gallery media, engine capabilities, route destinations, and poster selection remain
runtime policy. They are not localized editorial content and do not belong in the `examples`
document block.

## Refactor Checklist

Before moving code:

- run `npm run architecture:audit -- --min-lines 500` if you are choosing the next cleanup target
- identify behavior that must not change
- find route params, redirects, and metadata coupling
- check whether the file is server or client
- check whether imported modules are safe for the target boundary
- move one responsibility at a time

After moving code:

- run TypeScript/lint checks
- smoke-test the route
- compare important generated metadata/JSON-LD if the route is public
- confirm localized paths still resolve

## Current Line Caps

Use tighter caps once a route has been split:

- server `page.tsx` wrappers: usually 30-120 lines depending on metadata and redirects
- client route wrappers: usually below 40 lines
- route views: usually below 250-450 lines
- focused section components: usually below 150-250 lines
- large helper modules: allowed when they are pure and covered by contract tests, but still split when responsibilities diverge
