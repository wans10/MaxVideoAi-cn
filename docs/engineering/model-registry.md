# Model Registry Guide

`frontend/config/model-registry.json` is the only authored source for model identity, aliases, family, category, publication, replacement, and model-shaped tombstones.

The following files are generated projections and must not be edited directly:

- `frontend/config/model-runtime.json`
- `frontend/config/engine-catalog.json`
- `frontend/config/model-roster.json`
- `docs/model-roster.json`
- `docs/model-roster.csv`

`pnpm model:registry:check` validates the authored registry and then compares every generated projection exactly: runtime JSON, engine catalog, frontend roster, docs roster JSON, and docs roster CSV. Check mode is read-only; it never regenerates files or changes timestamps.

The browser-safe runtime projection omits the replacement graph. A retired replacement identity contains only an optional flattened `publicTargetId` for the final active model; active models need no extra field and resolve to themselves. Public-slug resolution uses that flattened target so middleware can send `/fr/models/*` and `/es/models/*` compatibility paths directly to the localized active canonical slug. Engine/input aliases still resolve to their original canonical product ID.

## Add a model

1. Add the provider/execution definition with its canonical `id` only. Keep provider-specific IDs in the adapter or mode definition.
2. Add one registry entry with canonical slug, family, category, empty alias arrays, and every publication field set explicitly.
3. Add `content/models/{en,fr,es}/{slug}.json` before publishing the model page. Review all
   three strict top-level `decision` blocks before publication, including the localized copy and
   hrefs, and verify that every `decision.modelSlug` exactly matches the new canonical slug.
4. Run `pnpm model:registry:generate`, `pnpm engine:catalog`, and `pnpm model:generate:write` to refresh the generated projections.
5. Run `pnpm model:registry:check` and the focused model/page tests.

`pnpm model:setup -- --from <source-slug> --slug <target-slug> --name "<Marketing Name>" --family <family-id>` can scaffold the localized content, provider/execution stub, registry entry skeleton, and optional presentation-only family stub.
The scaffold retargets `decision.modelSlug`, but its generated English, French, and Spanish
decision content still requires the manual review in the checklist above before publication.

## Rename a public slug

Keep the old slug in `aliases.publicSlugs`, change `slug`, regenerate the projections, and verify the generated English, French, and Spanish 301 matrix. Never replace an old slug with a hand-authored redirect in Next.js config, middleware, or a route.

## Retire a model

Set `replacement` to the canonical ID of the active destination model. A replacement entry is a retained URL identity, not a published model: turn off every publication surface, clear comparison relationships and ranks/labels, and keep its canonical slug plus all historical public aliases in the entry. The replacement target must publish a model page and cannot itself have a replacement. Chains, cycles, missing targets, and source collisions fail validation.

The Next.js redirect projection sends both the retired canonical slug and all of its historical public aliases directly to the replacement's canonical localized slug in English, French, and Spanish. The middleware applies the same flattened destination to wrong-English localized compatibility paths such as `/fr/models/*` and `/es/models/*`, including dotted historical aliases, while preserving the query string. Every generated rule is an explicit HTTP 301 and is one hop. Use a registry tombstone with `destination: "models-index"` only when the final destination is the localized catalogue. A tombstone is for a retired model-shaped URL, not a general redirect.

## Change publication

Change only the registry `publication` object. Do not add surface overrides to engine modules, family configs, pricing code, sitemap code, middleware, or route files. Regenerate projections and run `pnpm model:registry:check` so content and cross-surface invariants are validated.

`publication.model.published` controls whether the model route renders. `publication.model.indexable` controls robots metadata, and `publication.sitemap.published` controls sitemap inclusion. A published model may intentionally be noindex and absent from the sitemap; it must still render. An unpublished model returns the hidden/not-found route decision.

## Provider identifiers

Provider IDs stay in provider adapters and mode definitions. Do not add them to registry aliases merely to make provider routing work. Registry `aliases.internal` are historical MaxVideoAI engine/app inputs; `aliases.publicSlugs` are historical public URL slugs, and the two namespaces may intentionally resolve the same token differently.

## Required commands

Run these commands after an authored registry change:

```bash
pnpm model:registry:generate
pnpm engine:catalog
pnpm model:generate:write
pnpm model:registry:check
```

Commit the authored registry change and every refreshed generated projection together. If `pnpm model:registry:check` reports drift, regenerate instead of editing a projection by hand.
