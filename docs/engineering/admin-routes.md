# Admin Route Architecture

This guide defines the preferred split for admin pages in MaxVideoAI.

## Target Shape

Admin route files should stay small and server/client boundaries should be obvious.

For server admin routes:

```tsx
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const runtime = 'nodejs';

export default async function AdminFeaturePage(props: PageProps) {
  const params = await props.params;
  const data = await fetchAdminFeatureData(params);

  return <AdminFeatureView data={data} />;
}
```

For client admin routes:

```tsx
'use client';

export default function AdminFeaturePage() {
  const controller = useAdminFeatureController();

  return <AdminFeatureView {...controller} />;
}
```

## Route-Local Modules

Prefer route-local folders for admin feature code that is not shared:

```txt
frontend/app/(core)/admin/example/
  page.tsx
  _components/
    AdminExampleView.tsx
    AdminExampleTable.tsx
    AdminExampleInspector.tsx
  _hooks/
    useAdminExampleController.ts
  _lib/
    admin-example-data.ts
    admin-example-format.ts
    admin-example-metrics.ts
```

Use shared admin-system components for shell and surfaces:

- `AdminPageHeader`
- `AdminSection`
- `AdminSectionMeta`
- `AdminInspectorPanel`
- `AdminMetricGrid`
- `AdminDataTable`
- `AdminStatTable`
- `AdminNotice`
- `AdminEmptyState`
- `AdminPricingChangePreviewDialog`
- `AdminPricingHistory`

## Commercial Pricing Domains

Commercial administration has exactly three active route owners:

- `/admin/pricing` owns canonical engine pricing policy;
- `/admin/membership` owns membership thresholds and discounts;
- `/admin/billing-products` owns fixed products referenced by live billing consumers.

Do not add membership or product controls back to `/admin/pricing`. Do not add direct-save commercial routes. Each domain uses authorized inventory/history reads and a server-owned `preview → explicit confirmation → immediate apply` mutation protocol. Confirmation recomputes the preview fingerprint inside the transaction boundary before persistence.

The server rejects a stale preview fingerprint without persistence or cache invalidation. Every successful mutation and its immutable event commit in one transaction. Rollback is a new mutation: callbacks send only `targetId` and `eventId`, historical state is resolved server-side, and restoration enters the same fresh preview and confirmation flow. History is never updated or deleted.

Pricing proposals exclude settlement routing. `vendorAccountId` may appear only as read-only operational context; policy updates preserve its stored value and creates cannot set it. When the database is unavailable, public quote resolution may use versioned fallback policy, but commercial admin inventory must show the outage and every mutation must fail explicitly.

All three views share `AdminPricingHistory`. The old `/api/admin/membership-tiers` and `/api/admin/pricing/rules` endpoints are intentionally absent and must not be recreated as compatibility shims. The detailed operating procedure and verification commands live in `docs/engineering/pricing-engine.md` under **Safe price-change runbook**.

## What Belongs Where

Keep in `page.tsx`:

- route params
- auth/redirect/notFound gates
- server data fetch orchestration
- dynamic/runtime exports
- rendering the route view

Move out of `page.tsx`:

- metric builders
- table rendering
- status badges
- detail panels
- formatters
- filter normalization
- href builders
- support/action rails
- SWR or URL state hooks

## Detail Pages

For pages such as `admin/users/[userId]`, prefer these sections:

- identity/access section
- usage/spend section
- wallet/ledger section
- support actions inspector
- route-local format and metric helpers

Do not type detail components with `Awaited<ReturnType<typeof fetcher>>[...]` when the server module already exports named DTO types. Import named types with `import type`.

## Contract Tests

Every refactored admin route should have an architecture test that checks:

- route file line cap
- route imports its view/controller
- route still owns data fetch orchestration when server-rendered
- tables and badges are not in `page.tsx`
- helpers are exported from `_lib`
- major sections are exported from `_components`

Use existing tests as templates:

```txt
tests/admin-users-architecture.test.ts
tests/admin-user-detail-architecture.test.ts
tests/admin-video-seo-architecture.test.ts
tests/admin-seo-gsc-architecture.test.ts
```
