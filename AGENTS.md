# MaxVideoAI Engineering Guide

This file is the first reference for Codex, AI agents, and contributors working in this repository.

## Product Shape

MaxVideoAI is a production Next.js application for AI video generation, model comparison, examples, pricing, billing, media library, and admin operations.

The frontend lives in `frontend/`. Most product work should happen there.

## Codex Start Protocol

Before making code changes, Codex and other AI agents should:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/engineering/llm-working-guide.md` for the current AI-agent workflow.
3. Read the closest nested `AGENTS.md` for the area being changed, if one exists.
4. Inspect the relevant architecture or contract tests before moving responsibilities between files.
5. Check the current branch and worktree state before editing.

Do not rely on stale memory of previous cleanup waves. For architecture cleanup, run the current audit:

```bash
npm run architecture:audit -- --min-lines 500
```

If choosing targets for a larger cleanup, prefer the live audit output over dated roadmap snapshots.

## Guide Map

Use these guides as context before changing the related areas:

- `docs/engineering/project-structure.md`: where new code should live.
- `docs/engineering/page-architecture.md`: how route files, metadata, data builders, and page sections should be split.
- `docs/engineering/admin-routes.md`: admin route and admin UI conventions.
- `docs/engineering/refactor-roadmap.md`: cleanup strategy and historical context; confirm current line counts with the audit.
- `docs/engineering/model-registry.md`: required workflow for adding, renaming, retiring, or publishing models.
- `docs/engineering/stripe-webhook.md`: Stripe webhook security, idempotency, handler ownership, and validation gates.
- `frontend/app/(core)/(workspace)/app/AGENTS.md`: authenticated video workspace boundaries.
- `frontend/app/(core)/(workspace)/app/image/AGENTS.md`: image workspace boundaries.

When instructions conflict, follow the nearest `AGENTS.md` for the files being edited, while preserving the root-level rules.

## High-Level Layout

- `frontend/app`: Next.js App Router routes, route handlers, layouts, metadata, redirects, and route-level orchestration.
- `frontend/components`: Shared React components. Put reusable UI here when it is used by more than one route or feature.
- `frontend/components/ui`: Low-level reusable UI primitives.
- `frontend/lib`: Pure application logic, formatting, route helpers, SEO helpers, pricing helpers, and browser-safe utilities.
- `frontend/server`: Server-only data access and backend orchestration.
- `frontend/config`: Product catalog and configuration data.
- `frontend/content`, `frontend/messages`, `content`: Localized content and documentation surfaces.
- `docs`: Human-facing engineering, deployment, SEO, pricing, licensing, and operating guides.
- `neon/migrations`: Application database migrations. Do not put application database migrations in Supabase.
- `supabase`: Supabase Auth configuration only.

## Model Registry Ownership

`frontend/config/model-registry.json` is the only authored source for model identity, aliases, family, category, publication, replacement, and model-route tombstones. Follow `docs/engineering/model-registry.md` for every model policy change and run `pnpm model:registry:check` before committing.

`frontend/config/model-runtime.json`, `frontend/config/engine-catalog.json`, `frontend/config/model-roster.json`, and the roster files under `docs/` are generated projections. Do not edit them directly; regenerate them with the commands in the model registry guide.

## Page File Rule

Keep `page.tsx` files as route orchestrators.

A healthy `page.tsx` should usually:

- export `generateMetadata` and `generateStaticParams` when needed
- read route params and search params
- authorize, redirect, or call `notFound`
- fetch or compose route-level data
- render named sections/components

A `page.tsx` should avoid becoming the owner of:

- large JSX sections
- pricing algorithms
- SEO schema builders
- localization mapping tables
- browser storage helpers
- dashboards with many client-side panels
- chart/table rendering components

When a `page.tsx` grows past roughly 500 lines, prefer extracting the next meaningful responsibility before adding more code.

## Component Placement

Prefer colocated route components when the component is only used by one route:

```txt
frontend/app/(localized)/[locale]/(marketing)/models/[slug]/_components/
```

Prefer shared component folders when the component is reusable:

```txt
frontend/components/marketing/
frontend/components/admin-system/
frontend/components/library/
frontend/components/ui/
```

Use `*.client.tsx` for components that require browser APIs, event handlers, local state, effects, or client-only libraries.

## Server and Client Boundaries

Default to Server Components in `frontend/app`.

Add `'use client'` only when the file needs:

- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or other client hooks
- browser APIs like `window`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `File`, or `URL.createObjectURL`
- user interaction handlers
- client-only dependencies

Do not import server-only modules into client files. Anything using database access, secrets, `node:fs`, `node:path`, or admin checks belongs in server-side modules or route handlers.

## Refactor Style

Refactor incrementally:

- keep behavior unchanged unless the task explicitly asks for a behavior change
- move pure functions before moving JSX
- preserve existing public URLs, metadata behavior, and localization output
- avoid global rewrites that touch unrelated features
- keep user changes in the worktree intact

For large files, split by responsibility rather than by technical layer:

- data builders
- schema/metadata builders
- pricing/spec helpers
- route sections
- client-only interactions
- tables/charts/panels

For large-file cleanup, a good refactor batch should:

- reduce a real owner file, not just move code around for aesthetics
- keep public imports stable when possible
- add or update architecture tests that lock the new boundary
- avoid mixing risky behavior changes with file-organization work
- stop when the next extraction has a worse risk/reward profile than the current benefit

## Workspace App Boundaries

For the authenticated workspace route, keep `frontend/app/(core)/(workspace)/app/AppClient.tsx` as the route-level orchestrator.

- Keep route shell rendering in `_components/WorkspaceAppShell.tsx`; `AppClient.tsx` should not compose `WorkspaceChrome`, `GalleryRail`, the center gallery, or the preview dock inline.
- Keep notice timers, onboarding route redirects, and preview/viewer composition in route-local hooks under `_hooks/`.
- Keep composer engine/mode orchestration in `_hooks/useWorkspaceEngineModeState.ts`; `useWorkspaceComposerState.ts` should focus on composer input field state and field handlers.
- Keep wallet balance preflight in `_hooks/useWorkspaceWalletPreflight.ts`; `useWorkspaceGenerationRunner.ts` should focus on generation submission, local render state, accepted results, and polling.
- Keep workspace asset library, reference field assets, and Kling element assets split across `_hooks/useWorkspaceAssetLibrary.ts`, `_hooks/useWorkspaceReferenceAssets.ts`, and `_hooks/useWorkspaceKlingElementAssets.ts`; `useWorkspaceAssets.ts` should stay an orchestrator.
- Keep composer JSX in `_components/WorkspaceComposerSurface.tsx` and shared modal wiring in `_components/WorkspaceRuntimeModals.tsx`.
- Add or update contract tests in `tests/workspace-*-contract.test.ts` when moving workspace responsibilities, so the architecture stays explicit.

## Architecture Contracts

Architecture tests are part of the project design, not incidental test coverage.

When moving responsibilities, inspect and update the relevant tests in `tests/*architecture.test.ts` or `tests/*contract.test.ts`.

Examples:

- route/page splits: `tests/*-architecture.test.ts`
- workspace boundaries: `tests/workspace-*-contract.test.ts`
- provider/server boundaries: provider-specific architecture tests such as `tests/byteplus-provider-architecture.test.ts`
- SEO and localized routes: SEO, sitemap, hreflang, slug, and route architecture tests

If a test asserts that a file should import a helper or stay under a line threshold, treat that as intentional architecture documentation.

## Verification

Use focused checks first:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm run lint:exposure
git diff --check
```

For architecture refactors, also run the related architecture or contract tests directly before broader validation.

For route refactors, also run the relevant app locally and smoke-test the touched pages.

For public/SEO pages, verify:

- canonical URL
- hreflang output
- JSON-LD script output
- localized path behavior
- redirect behavior
- sitemap inclusion assumptions

For client app pages, verify:

- auth flow still works
- browser storage reads/writes still work
- loading and empty states still render
- dynamic imports still open on demand
- no obvious extra re-render loops

## Documentation

When adding a new feature area, add or update the relevant guide in `docs/engineering/` if future work would otherwise require rediscovering the architecture.
